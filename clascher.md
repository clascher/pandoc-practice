I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

* GitHub
* Codeanywhere - command shell
* Markup
    * Markdown
    * HTML
* CSS
* Jekyll
* Pandoc

# Which have you found most potentially useful? 

* Codeanywhere
* Markdown

## Why? 

I was *fascinated* by the idea of moving away from Microsoft Word, presented by you and in Pavel Iosad's article, "Getting off the Word Standard:  Your Academic Life in Plain Text".  I have not been that frustrated with MSWord, but I appreciate the distraction-free work environment writing in plaintext provides.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

* Codeanywhere (**at first**)
* HTML

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

Codeanywhere was difficult to use at first because it was so unlike anything I had ever used before.  Now that I have more familiarity with it, I am not concerned.  HTML is difficult for me to learn and use because it is not an intuitive language and there is so much room for error.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

* Pandoc
* LaTeX/TeX

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
