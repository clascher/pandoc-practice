<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I was <em>fascinated</em> by the idea of moving away from Microsoft Word, presented by you and in Pavel Iosad's article, &quot;Getting off the Word Standard: Your Academic Life in Plain Text&quot;. I have not been that frustrated with MSWord, but I appreciate the distraction-free work environment writing in plaintext provides.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Codeanywhere (<strong>at first</strong>)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>Codeanywhere was difficult to use at first because it was so unlike anything I had ever used before. Now that I have more familiarity with it, I am not concerned. HTML is difficult for me to learn and use because it is not an intuitive language and there is so much room for error.</p>

<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
